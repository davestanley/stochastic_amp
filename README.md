### Overview

This minimal model investigates stochastic amplification of
calcium-activated potassium (KCa) currents. Amplification results
from calcium being released in short high amplitude pulses associated
with the stochastic gating of calcium channels in microdomains.
This model predicts that such pulsed release of calcium significantly
increases subthreshold SK2 currents above what would be produced by
standard deterministic models. However, there is little effect on a
simple sAHP current kinetic scheme. This suggests that calcium
stochasticity and microdomains should be considered when modeling
certain KCa currents near subthreshold conditions.

This model produces results similar to those in Figure 9 of
Stanley et al (2011). It contains several other kinetic
configurations that can be investigated as well. Note that the
original data in Figure 9 was implemented in GENESIS rather than
Matlab. Although the paper considers a CA1 pyramidal cell as an
example, this could be relevant in other cell types as well,
where KCa channels are coupled to a stochastic calcium source.

This implementation is by David Stanley, to whom questions should
be addressed.
